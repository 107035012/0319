```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

```{r}
par(mfrow = c(3, 1))
hist(mtcars$mpg)
hist(mtcars$cyl)
hist(mtcars$hp)
```
```{r}
plot(mtcars$mpg, mtcars$hp)
```
## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
